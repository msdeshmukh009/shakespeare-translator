        <p class="footer-txt">Convert from English to Shakespeare. Shakespeare invented many words and his 
            style of narration in many ways was unique to his time. His ever popular
             works ( dramas and poems ) makes his language style live even today. 
             This translator takes English as input and converts to Shakespeare English.</p>
